# This is tutorial for install nodejs and yarn on Ubuntu 18
Version:
- Nodejs 8.10
- Yarn 1.17.3
## 1. Setup NodeJS
In current, Nodejs is available on repository of Ubuntu, you can type following command:

```bash
sudo apt install nodejs
```

## 2. Setup Yarn
On Debian or Ubuntu Linux, you can install Yarn via our Debian package repository. You will first need to configure the repository:

```bash
curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list
```

Then you can simply:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install yarn
```

**Path Setup**

If Yarn is not found in your PATH, follow these steps to add it and allow it to be run from anywhere.

Note: your profile may be in your ``.profile``,      ``.bash_profile``, ``.bashrc``, ``.zshrc``, etc.

- Add this to your profile: ``export PATH="$PATH:/opt/yarn-[version]/bin"`` (the path may vary depending on where you extracted Yarn to)
- In the terminal, log in and log out for the changes to take effect

To have access to Yarnâ€™s executables globally, you will need to set up the PATH environment variable in your terminal. To do this, add ``export PATH="$PATH:`yarn global bin`"`` to your profile.

Test that Yarn is installed by running:

```bash
yarn --version
```
